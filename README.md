# Practical-AI-Course
In this series of lessons, you will learn the basics of a veriaty of AI algorithms and models. You also explore basic usecases of libraries that implemented these AI methods. By the end of the course, you will have a foundational understanding of what AI is, the notable algorithms in AI from 1950 to the present, and how to use them to solve problems using Python.

For this course, you should:
- have a basic understanding of Python,
- Be motivation and a self-learner.

# Lessons
The topics covered so far are:
## 1. History of AI
We explore the journey AI has taken, from simple AI agents and solvers to the large-scale AI systems widely used today, including LLMs (Large Language Models).

## 2. Search Algorithms
We dive into the concept of searching, and study the well-known algorithm called $A^\star$ . We see some examples and, by the end, solve a simple maze puzzle using the `networkx` library and its implementation of $A^\star$.
