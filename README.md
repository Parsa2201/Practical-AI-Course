# Practical-AI-Course
In this series of lessons, you will understand the basics of a veriaty of AI algorithms and models. You also learn basic usecases of libraries implemented these AIs. At the end of the course, you will have a basic understanding of what is AI, the famous algorithms in AI from 1950 until now, and how we can use them to solve problems using python.

For this course you will have to:
- have a basic understanding of python,
- have motivation and be a self-learner.

# Lessons
The topics until now are:
## 1. History of AI
We talk about the path AI has gone through, from the basic AI agents and solvers, to the gigantic AIs and the most widely used AIs called LLMs.

## 2. Search Algorithms
We dive into what do we mean by searching, and the famous search algorithm called $A^\star$ . We see some examples and at the end solve a simple maze puzzle using the library `networkx` and its $A^\star$ algorithm.
